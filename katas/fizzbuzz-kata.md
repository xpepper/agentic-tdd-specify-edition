# FizzBuzz Kata

## Description

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

## Requirements

- For numbers divisible by 3, return "Fizz"
- For numbers divisible by 5, return "Buzz"
- For numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, return "FizzBuzz"
- For all other numbers, return the number as a string

## Examples

```
fizzbuzz(1) -> "1"
fizzbuzz(2) -> "2"
fizzbuzz(3) -> "Fizz"
fizzbuzz(5) -> "Buzz"
fizzbuzz(15) -> "FizzBuzz"
```

## Rules

- Follow TDD (Test-Driven Development) strictly
- Start with the simplest test case
- Write minimal code to pass each test
- Refactor after each passing test
